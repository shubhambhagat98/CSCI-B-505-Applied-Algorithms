    "### Part 1:\n",
    "- Normally, the complexity of radix sort is **O(d * (n + b))** time where **d** is the number of digits in the maximum element of the sequence and **b** is the base. For decimal numbers, base is 10.\n",
    "- if n is ***sufficiently larger*** than d, the runtime becomes **O(n)**. Consider below example:\n",
    ">Say for sequence of n numbers where **n<=1000000**, largest number in sequence  is **3654** ( ie: d = 4, n<=1000000 ), the runtime is dependent on the value of n. Hence we can say the the runtime for this example is **O(n)**. *( we can ignore 'b' because b is 10 . i.e: b is constant )*.\n",
    "- However, when **d is larger than n**, the **runtime is bound by value of d**. Consider below example:\n",
    ">Say we have a list  [ 10, 356, 123456789 ].Here, n= 3 and d = 9. Thus, even is n is 3, runtime is bound(dependent) by d. Therefore the runtime becomes **O(d(n))**.  *( We can ignore 'b' because b is 10 . i.e: b is constant )*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2:\n",
    "- For the given question, we have a constraint that if list has n elements, the numbers can be in range 0 to n<sup>2</sup>-1.\n",
    "- For n = 100, the maximum element in the list would be 100<sup>2</sup>-1 = 9999. Thus, the value of d for the given condition would be 4. This is equivalent to log<sub>10</sub>(n<sup>2</sup>-1) = log<sub>10</sub>(9999) = 3.99999 **≈ 4** \n",
    "- Now, log<sub>10</sub>(10000) = 4 and log<sub>10</sub>(9999) = 3.99999. Thus, when n is **sufficiently large**, we can say that log<sub>10</sub>(n<sup>2</sup>-1) ≈ log<sub>10</sub>(n<sup>2</sup>). \n",
    ">Thus **d ≈ log<sub>10</sub>(n<sup>2</sup>).**    \n",
    "> log<sub>10</sub>(n<sup>2</sup>) = 2log<sub>10</sub>(n). \n",
    "> Hence d ≈ 2log<sub>10</sub>(n)  ≈  O(log<sub>10</sub>(n))\n",
    "- Therefore the rutime of Radix sort becomes **O(log<sub>b</sub>(n) * (n + b))**.\n",
    "- Now we know that  log<sub>n</sub>(n) = 1 and n+n = 2n ≈ O(n). Thus we can make the runtime complexity as linear by taking **b ( base ) = n.**\n",
    "- Thus, If b = n, O(log<sub>n</sub>(n) * (n + n)) = O(1 * (2n)) = **O(n)**.\n",

    "- In the Counting sort algorithm, we consider 3 lists; \n",
    "    - A is the input sequence,\n",
    "    - B is our output sequence\n",
    "    - C is the counting list.\n",
    "- We calculate the count of occurence of each element in A and store it at the appropriate index in C. Suppose element '2' appears 4 times in A, then C[2] will be 4 and so on.\n",
    "- We the calculate the cumulative of these counts and store it again in C. A cummulative sum at any index in C tells us how many elements will be there in sorted array - B before that index.\n",
    "- Finally, in the last for loop, We traverse the list A from the last element. The element 'x' in A tells us which index should we look in count array C. The element at that index in C, tells us the index in output array B where we should store element 'x' of A.\n",
    "- Then we decrement the count for that element by 1 in the count array C.\n",
    "- After the final iteration, we get our sorted list B.\n",
    "- Worst case time complexity for Counting sort is **O(n + k)** where k is the length of our counting array ie. k is max(A)"
